# RM_CLASS
Welcome to the RM_CLASS repository!

The official training hub for the Algorithm Team of the Fuzhou University `浮舟湿地` for the 2025 season. The `main` branch contains markdown documents and reference solutions for each training session, making it easy to access learning materials and review exercises.

This training program is divided into several key parts, as follows:

> The Environment based on Ubuntu22.04 ROS2-Humle

## CLASS_1: Introduction to Linux and ROS2, Basic Programming

- **Initial Setup: Linux and ROS2 Installation**
  - Set up a Linux environment and install ROS2 along with the pre-installed packages for hands-on experience.
  
- **Introduction to Programming Languages**
  - Learn the basics of C++ and Python, essential programming languages for robotics development.
  - Understand Markdown for creating well-structured documentation.

## CLASS_2: Getting Started with Linux, ROS, and Computer Vision

- **Linux Fundamentals**
  - Familiarize yourself with Linux commands and the operating system environment.

- **Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)**
  - Install ROS and write your first ROS2 node.
  - Learn about ROS topics, communication mechanisms, messages, and related concepts.

## CLASS 3: Introduction to Computer Vision and Basic Object Detection

- **Installing OpenCV and Setting Up the Environment**
  - Set up OpenCV on your system to begin exploring computer vision techniques.
  - Learn to implement essential functions like reading images, video capture, and basic image manipulation using OpenCV.

- **Basic Color Detection**
  - Implement a real-time color detection system using a webcam.
  - Understand how to process images in different color spaces (e.g., HSV) and apply thresholds to detect specific colors.
  
- **Object Recognition**
  - Develop a simple object recognition system using OpenCV, leveraging techniques such as contour detection and template matching.
  - Learn to identify basic shapes and objects based on color and geometric features.

## CLASS 4: Armor Plate Recognition and SLAM Navigation Simulation

- **Armor Plate Detection with Computer Vision**
  - Using a webcam, implement a system to detect armor plates in real-time by processing video frames.
  - Explore techniques such as edge detection, contour finding, and template matching to identify armor plates in dynamic environments.

- **SLAM Navigation Simulation with ROS**
  - Integrate ROS with OpenCV to simulate robotic navigation using a camera feed.
  - Learn how to implement a simple SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system to create maps of the environment while navigating.
  - Use ROS to control a specified robot chassis and simulate its navigation while scanning for obstacles and mapping the surroundings.

## CLASS 5: YOLOv5 Deployment and Object Detection

- **Deploying YOLOv5 for Object Detection**
  - Learn how to deploy the YOLOv5 deep learning model for object detection.
  - Install necessary dependencies and set up the YOLOv5 environment for real-time object identification in video streams.

- **Training and Fine-tuning YOLOv5**
  - Explore how to fine-tune the YOLOv5 model using custom datasets to detect specific objects relevant to your project (e.g., armor plates, other objects of interest).
  - Learn how to evaluate the model’s performance and improve accuracy by adjusting hyperparameters or augmenting training data.

- **Real-time Object Detection with YOLOv5**
  - Implement real-time object detection with YOLOv5, capturing frames from a camera and running the detection model on each frame to identify and classify objects.
